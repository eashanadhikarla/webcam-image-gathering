# Webcam Image Gathering

To capture images periodically through public webcams.
The repository contains different algorithms to capture live video frames in a periodic manner from the specified link.

## Prerequites
* Python-3.6
* OpenCV-3.x
* Vidgear
* Pydrive
* Streamlink
* ffmpeg

I covered mostly webcam links from Earthcam.com, Youtube.com, and other State websites hosting a group of webcams for a specific location.
The entire work covers webcam images only* and scope is designed particularly for United States Webcam links, although it is expected to work on other locations too, but not gauranteed.
