# Webcam Image Gathering

To capture images periodically through public webcams.
The repository contains different algorithms to capture live video frames periodically from the specified link.

## Prerequites
* Python-3.6
* OpenCV-3.x
* Vidgear
* Pydrive
* Streamlink
* ffmpeg

I covered mostly webcam links from Earthcam.com, Youtube.com, and other State websites hosting a group of webcams for a specific location. The entire work covers webcam images only* and the scope is designed mainly for the United States Webcam links. However, I expect it to work in other locations too, but not guaranteed.
